== Description ==

Post Loaded Avatars makes it so the avatar images on a page are the last items to load.  This clears the way for other content to load quicker and can decrease the page load time for Google.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin.  No options to configure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't it working? =

It might be working, it's just really fast.  If you view the source and find the term "data-src", it's probably working just fine.

= No really, it's not working =

There might be conflicts if you are using another lazy load script or if another plugin is applying filters to the comments.
